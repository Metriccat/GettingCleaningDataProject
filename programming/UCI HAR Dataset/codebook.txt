Codebook for the variables in the data set tidy_means.txt created by the run_analysis.R script.

This data is processed from the original data described at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw time dependent signals. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing coresponding frequency domain signals.

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
